        "value": "<p>There’s nothing complicated about roasting. It’s as easy as baking a pie, maybe even simpler as there’s just one ingredient. What’s complicated is fine-tuning the whole process to perfection. It’s also a huge responsibility. You can easily ruin something that’s been in the works for months and has been perfect up until now.</p><h3>Light Roasts</h3><p>Usually roasted for 6-8 minutes or simply until achieving a light brown color. This method is used for milder coffee varieties and for coffee tasting. This type of roasting allows the natural characteristics of each coffee to show. The aroma of coffees produced from light roasts is usually more intense. The cup itself is more acidic and the concentration of caffeine is higher.</p><h3>Medium roast</h3><p>These exempt a stronger flavor than light roasts. The beans are still more matte than oily. Caffeine contents are decreased. Medium roasts lack the grainy taste of lighter roasts. You also get a more balanced flavor, aroma and acidity.</p><h3>Dark Roasts</h3><p>Dark roast beans are achieved by a 12-13 minute roasting process. The beans have a heavier body, a surface that appears a little oily and a somewhat shiny. Darker roasts have a more chocolate-like flavor. The sugars in the coffee caramelize more than with light roasts and make their way to the surface of the bean. This makes the beans less acidic as well.</p><p>To put it in points, these are general rules that apply to different levels of roasts:</p><ul><li>Caffeine level decreases the darker the roast is.</li><li>Darker roasts exempt less acidity than lighter roasts.</li><li>The darker beans get roasted, the oilier their surface becomes.</li><li>Lighter roasts maintain more of the original flavors of their varieties, while the darker they get, they tend to take on more flavor from the roasting process itself.</li><li>The body of the coffee gets heavier until taken to really high temperatures, where they emit what is called a ‘second crack’. Then the body starts thinning out again.</li></ul><p>You can easily imprint your own signature into each coffee that you make during the roasting process. At Dancing Goat, though, we choose to instead highlight what makes of the varietal great and unique.</p>"

          "value": "<p>Arabica Bourbon is among the best coffee varieties you can find in Brazil, Salvador, and Rwanda. This widely known and popular coffee is cultivated in three color varieties, red, orange and yellow bourbon. But what does it have in common with the American whiskey? Nothing at all, fortunately.</p>\n<p>The name comes from the place of origin of this wonderful variety, which is a small island in the Indian Ocean called Réunion, formerly Bourbon. The earliest records mentioning coffee from this lovely volcanic island come from merchants of the East Indian Company and date from the beginning of the 18th century. The first exports started in 1718, and the coffee usually went to Mokka harbor in Yemen and then on to Europe. Exports started off slowly at first. Just less than two tons were shipped in 1724, but this increased rapidly over the next hundred years, peaking at 2,440 tons of coffee per year.</p>\n<p>The coffee, first called Café du Roy, then Café Leroy, was served to kings at the French court and was the brand of choice of the classic author, Honoré de Balzac, who enjoyed forty cups a day. Or so they say…</p>\n<p>The Bourbon variety found its way to Latin America around the middle of the 19th century, where it gradually replaced the older Ethiopian variety, the Arabica Typica, mainly because of its 30% larger yield. While the Arabica Bourbon was doing well in the world, the production on Réunion was slowly, but steadily, decreasing year by year. Farmers opted to grow sugarcane, tea and vanilla beans instead of coffee, and therefore 1942 marked the last export of Arabica Bourbon from the island of Réunion. The last harvest came eight years later and then the variety was forgotten about, even by the locals.</p>\n<p>After almost sixty years, one unrelenting Japanese coffee specialist from Ueshima Coffee Company discovered 27 original plants and restarted production. The resulting coffee is called Bourbon Pointu. It is sold only in Japan and holds the prestigious Premium Product title from the Specialty Coffee Association of Japan. It is also quite pricey, at $35 for 4 ounces.</p>\n<p>The Bourbon Pointu is exceptional for its low volume of caffeine and delicate taste with a slight acidity, low bitterness, full body, and the charming fruit flavor of oranges and tangerines.</p>\n<p>One can only hope that the island of Réunion will eventually return to its former coffee glory and that we will be able to enjoy Bourbon Pointu as well.</p>\n<p>If you are curious about the original taste of Arabica Bourbon, go ahead and try our (Guatemala Finca El Injerto)&nbsp;or newly imported (El Salvador Finca San Jose).</p>"

          "value": "<p>Before a ripe coffee plant transforms into a delicious cup lying on your table, it undergoes quite a journey. A journey full of possible pitfalls, which can, usually negatively, influence the coffee’s final taste. What goes wrong at the very beginning cannot be made up for at the very end.</p>\n<p>The character and taste of a coffee are largely influenced by its origin, climate, the quality and type of soil and the botanical varieties of the coffee plant.</p>\n<p>The last two links of the chain—the roastery and the barista—cannot, in any way, improve the taste of the coffee. They are left with the difficult task of making the most its potential.</p>\n<p>The farmers themselves, however, have at their disposal tools for enhancing the ‘ingrown’ taste of the coffee. These are mainly the methods of removing the multilayered skin of the coffee beans.</p>\n<p>Two, sometimes three basic methods are usually referred to. Wet-Processed (Fully-Washed), Dry-Processed (Natural) and Pulped-Natural (Semi-Washed).</p>\n<p>Dry processing, being the least economically demanding, used to be the most widely used of the methods. More exclusive beans are now usually processed using the wet and pulped-natural processing. This is due to the quality and cleanliness of the beans, as well as the speed of the whole process. If you are curious about the taste, go ahead and try the <a data-item-id=\"80c7074b-3da1-4e1d-882b-c5716ebb4d25\" href=\"\">Kenya Gakuyuni AA</a>.</p>\n<p>Wet processing rids the cherry of its layers and pulp by water fermentation. The exocarp is removed from the cherries directly after the harvest using circular and drum mechanical peelers. Afterwards, they spend 6-72 hours in water-filled fermentation tanks.</p>\n<p>In the tank, microorganisms take care of the pulp (mesocarp). The length of the process is determined by the stickiness of the beans. Leaving beans in the fermentation tank for too long produces the so-called ‘naughty’ beans. These are often beans that have stuck in the tank and their rancid and putrid state endangers the whole batch.</p>\n<p>The constantly rising levels of acetic acid are also able to impact the taste of the coffee with fermented and even vinegarish tones once it’s been roasted. The main negative aspect of wet processing is the amount of water that has to be used. This is up to 40m3 (40000 liters) of water, that have to be continuously dumped and new, clean water has to be put pumped into the tank. The dumping of contaminated water often depreciates the water supplies laying underneath the coffee farm.</p>\n<p>The dry method, considered the most traditional and the least costly, makes use of sun-drying. Cherries are often sundried on concrete courtyards, Ethiopian hilltops, and sometimes even on the very shrubs.</p>\n<p>Cherries need to be sundried directly after the harvest to avoid unwanted fermentation. The laid out beans need to be layered evenly and not 6 inches (15cm) in height. Farmers turn the seeds over both manually or with the use of tractors.</p>\n<p>During the dry fermentation, the sugars travel, via osmosis, from the pulp into the beans. This makes for more full-bodied coffee and adds sweeter tones to the taste, as compared to wet processed coffee. This often comes at the cost of a more polluted cup.</p>\n<p>Once the coffee beans reach some 11 % humidity, the peel layers and pulp can be removed using mechanical peelers. Reaching the desired humidity takes anywhere between 10 and 30 days. This is an important factor, especially in unstable climates, where automatic driers often replace the traditional sun drying process.</p>\n<p>Now’s the time for ‘reposo’, a resting time, in which the beans lay in a parchment for 30-60 days.</p>\n<p>The third method, popular primarily in Brazil, is the so-called Pulped-Natural or Semi-Washed way of processing beans. Check out our <a data-item-id=\"0c9a11bb-6fc3-409c-b3cb-f0b797e15489\" href=\"\">Brazil Natural Barra Grande</a> coffee for a tasty example. Only the top layer of the cherry peel is removed in a water bath. The rest of the process, including the sugar fermentation and the separation of the pulp from the bean, are taken care of by sun drying. This method, just like the dry method, is highly dependent on the weather, which has to be consistent for the farmers to be able to dry the beans thoroughly.</p>\n<p>This process yields full-bodied beans with low-acidity. Less aliphatic acids are produced, which has a negative impact on the aroma of the coffee.</p>"
